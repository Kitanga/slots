# Slots game

This is a simple slot machine game. Really had fun doing this, also felt really good designing again, even though I'm not the best, I still do enjoy it a lot. You can check out the '__\_research__' folder.

Initially, my plan was to use Phaser 3, but then quickly reallized that using html would be an easier route, since the animations were very simple (flickering lights, spinning slot symbols, etc.), and I could take advantage of CSS animation caching and GPU acceleration without too much code.

It isn't the most beautiful game, but I definitely had fun creating it, to the point that I had to stop myself after noticing that I was adding feature after feature to the score system. By the way, all the music was made by me, the main menu music took about 8-9 hours of tinkering (25/11/2019 - in case I update this), so please do be understanding if it's a bit _rough_.

Anyways I hope you enjoy this simple little experiment, I will look to update this with better music (I'm looking into adding jazzhop like music, or just jazz outright).

This game was made using:

- Phaser 3 project template: as my project template, since I initially wanted to create a phaser based game.
- LMMS: I composed all the music using LMMS
- Audacity: I used audacity for recording and editing some sound effects
- GIMP: All the designs were created using this.
- Inkscape: I had to edit some `.ai` files and SVGs at some point and thus used Inkscape. Though I did have to tinker with the raw files as well to get some info out and add animations.
- [Freepik](http://freepik.com/): I got almost all my images from here, this can be seen in the design documents in the '__\_research__' folder
- [Free Sound](https://freesound.org/): Slot machine sounds came from here
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Used the font Poppins from here, then added some `-webkit-text-stroke` for that wonderfully overused text outline.
